# GSP-RenderX
GSP-RenderX is a web-based 3D engine replacing heavy STLs with a custom, compressed GSP format. It uses Edge-Aware Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct objects in real-time. By mapping particles to geometric constraints, it delivers sharp, CAD-quality visuals and ultra-fast, lightweight rendering via Three.js.
